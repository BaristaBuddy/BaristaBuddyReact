  <Card.Text>
  "My name is Sihem Azibi. I came to the United States 6 years ago from the country of Algeria. I studied computer science there and graduated with a Master's degree in information systems. When I joined my husband in the United States in 2013, I didn't speak English so I had to start from the bottom of the workforce. I started by working in retail stores then worked as a school bus driver for the Iowa City Community School District for 5 years. I recently heard about DeltaV coding school. I decided to join for the 101 class to see how it was and ended up signing for all of the courses through 401. It was about time for me to go back to what I am most passionate about; computer science ."
